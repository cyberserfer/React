# Creating a New Application

Create React App is the best way to start building a new React single page application. It sets up your development environment 
so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. 
Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine.
```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app

cd my-app
npm start
```
