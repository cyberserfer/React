#Programming Definitions

arrow function expression - shorter syntax than a function expression and does not have its own this, arguments,
super, or new.target. These function expressions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

expression -  a combination of one or more explicit values, constants, variables, operators, and functions that the 
programming language interprets. JavaScript has the following expression categories:

  Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example 3.14159. (Generally uses arithmetic operators.) 
  String: evaluates to a character string, for example, "Fred" or "234". (Generally uses string operators.) 
  Logical: evaluates to true or false. (Often involves logical operators.) 
  Object: evaluates to an object. (See special operators for various ones that evaluate to objects.)"

object literal - 

promise - 

statements - comprises the body of the function.
```
function name([param[, param[, ... param]]]) {
   statements
}
```
