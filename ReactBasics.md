Arrow Function Expression - has a shorter syntax than a function expression and does not have its own this, 
arguments, super, or new.target. These function expressions are best suited for non-method functions, and they 
cannot be used as constructors. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions
