# React Lifecycle Methods

## Mounting Lifecycle Methods

There are three categories of lifecycle methods: mounting, updating, and unmounting. 

Mounting lifecycle methods:

A component "mounts" when it renders for the first time. This is when mounting lifecycle methods get called.

There are three mounting lifecycle methods:

    componentWillMount
    render
    componentDidMount

When a component mounts, it automatically calls these three methods, in order. Lifecycle events only execute the first time that a component renders.
